# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using DenseNet201

This repository contains a deep learning project for **multiclass brain tumor classification** (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor) using **DenseNet201**. The model achieves **\~98% test accuracy** on MRI datasets through transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-tuned hyperparameters.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

* **Objective:** Detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images.
* **Dataset:** MRI images divided into four classes:

  * Glioma
  * Meningioma
  * Pituitary
  * No Tumor
* **Model:** DenseNet201 (ImageNet pre-trained) with custom dense layers, batch normalization, and dropout.
* **Result:** Achieved **97.9% test accuracy** with robust precision, recall, and F1-scores.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* Data preprocessing with **OpenCV + PIL**
* Image augmentation using **Keras `ImageDataGenerator`**
* Transfer learning with **DenseNet201**
* Early stopping to avoid overfitting
* Visualizations:

  * Confusion Matrix
  * Classification Report
  * Accuracy & Loss Curves
  * Per-class accuracy

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, PIL

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/brain-tumor-classification.git
cd brain-tumor-classification

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset should be structured as:

```
Training/
│── glioma/
│── meningioma/
│── notumor/
│── pituitary/
```

> ⚠️ Note: Only `.jpg` and `.jpeg` images are processed.

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
# Train the model
python train.py

# Evaluate the model
python evaluate.py
```

* The trained model will be saved as:

  ```
  BrainTumorModel2.keras
  ```

---

✅ **Recommendation:** Create a `requirements.txt` with your dependencies (`tensorflow`, `keras`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `pillow`).

**Next step:** Do you want me to also generate a `requirements.txt` file automatically from your imports so you can push it to GitHub along with the README?
